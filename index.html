		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
		<p>From western Philadelphia I hail
		where in my youth I'd play upon the green
		'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
		by ruffians contemptible and mean.
		Although the spat was trivial and brief,
		it wounded my dear mother deep within;
		and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
		she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
		When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
		I came upon a coachman most unique;
		and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
		despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
		I survey all the land with princely mien
		in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>

Introduction
Hi, my name is Israel Collazo. I am a 34 year old husband and father. I love clean and modern web design and I love reading about technological advances on and off the web. I'm the guy that looks at things and asks, "I'd love to learn to do that!"

In the past, I've tried to learn to code but I always found the material just wasn't well explained or lacking. Currently, I've enrolled in the Frontend Web Development course at Thinkful. The difference, as opposed to what I've tried before, is that now have a 1 on 1 mentor and a community of other classmates I can turn to for help when I get stuck with a problem.

My short-term goal is to master frontend web development. Ultimately, I want to backend development and become a Full Stack Developer.

Where I'm From
I'm from Pomona, California just west of Los Angeles. I currently live in Ontario California with my wife, daughter and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/israelcollazo/6279355468/">dog</a>.

More About Me

I come from Mexican immigrant parents and I am the middle child of 7 sibblings. Growing up, life was tough at times. My parents didn't have money to spend on video games let alone buy a computer so they bought us art supplies instead and it is from this that I grew up drawing and painting. My love for computers didn't come until much later in life around 2004 when I began working for a company that sold on ebay. There I learned to how to use the web, eCommerce, basics in html and css, and Photoshop. However, what interested me most at the time was Photoshop because coding just seemed too complicated for me so I started designing for Print and later for web.

Years passed and my only regret is not having learned to code earlier. I am now commited to learning and starting a chapter in my life as a developer.

My family, health, and carrer.

What music have you been listening to lately?
I think I can honestly say I'm the most ecclectic music lover I know. Lately, I've been listening to Empire of the Sun.
